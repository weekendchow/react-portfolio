          Yes, you probably already know my name when you open this site.
          I am <b>Mo Zhou</b>, a <b>Font-End developer</b> graduated from the <b>University of Ottawa</b>.
          Currently living in Ottawa, Canada.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy the process of creating fun things since I was a child and great designs as well as fun concepts always attract me.
          In the meantime, I am a very logical and organized person.
          So, after years of education and self-teaching on programming, my skills in <b>HTML & CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, ReactJS, React Native</b> and so on have been developed.
          Now I‚Äôm making interesting websites and apps that serving people and I‚Äôm loving it!
        </p>
        <p>
          It‚Äôs very lucky for me to accomplish my master degree in a different country.
          This opens up my perspective and I believe that <b>keep learning</b> and <b>keep travelling</b> will definitely make me a wiser person.
          So, if I am not coding now, you might find me exploring the world, learning new skills, watching movies, playing video games, or snowboardingüèÇ!
